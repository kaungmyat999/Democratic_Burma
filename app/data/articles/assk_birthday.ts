Today, on the birthday of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, we pause to reflect on her role in Myanmar’s decades-long struggle for democracy. For many, she has represented resilience, dignity, and the deep yearning of the people to live free from fear and military oppression.

Her leadership has been a source of hope for millions striving for justice. At the same time, we acknowledge that the path toward true democracy is complex, and that healing will require an inclusive approach—one that addresses the needs and rights of all communities, including the Rohingya.

As we honor this day, we call for the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners detained by the military regime. Their continued imprisonment is a grave injustice and a barrier to peace and reconciliation.

We also stand in solidarity with all those who have suffered in silence, including the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities who have long faced discrimination, displacement, and violence. A truly democratic Myanmar must include justice for these communities, and ensure that every person—regardless of ethnicity or religion—can live with dignity, safety, and equal rights.

On this day, we reaffirm our commitment to a future Myanmar where democracy is restored, political prisoners are free, and no one is forgotten.

In hope and solidarity,
Democratic Burma

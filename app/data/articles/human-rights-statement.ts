# Statement on Recent Human Rights Violations

Democratic Burma strongly condemns the recent human rights violations that have occurred across the country. These violations represent a serious threat to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Burmese people.

## Documented Violations

Our monitoring team has documented numerous violations, including:

- Arbitrary arrests and detentions
- Excessive use of force against peaceful protesters
- Restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly
- Intimidation of journalists and civil society activists

## Call for Action

We call upon:

1. **International Community**: To impose targeted sanctions on those responsible for human rights abuses
2. **United Nations**: To establish an independent investigation mechanism
3. **ASEAN**: To hold the perpetrators accountable through regional mechanisms
4. **Civil Society**: To continue documenting and reporting violations

## Support for Victims

Democratic Burma is committed to supporting victims of human rights abuses through:

- Legal assistance
- Documentation of violations for future accountability
- Psychosocial support
- Advocacy at national and international levels

## Our Commitment

We remain steadfast in our commitment to promoting and protecting human rights in Burma. We will continue to work with partners locally and internationally to ensure that violations are documented, perpetrators are held accountable, and victims receive justice.

We stand in solidarity with all those who have suffered human rights abuses and reaffirm our dedication to building a Burma where human rights are respected, protected, and fulfilled for all.

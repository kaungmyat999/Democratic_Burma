# Internet Freedom Report 2023

Democratic Burma's annual report on internet freedom in Burma shows concerning trends in digital censorship and surveillance. This comprehensive assessment covers the period from January to December 2022.

## Key Findings

Our research has identified several troubling developments:

### Increased Censorship

- **Website Blocking**: 234 websites were blocked in 2022, a 45% increase from 2021
- **Content Removal**: Government requests for content removal increased by 78%
- **Self-Censorship**: 67% of surveyed internet users reported self-censoring online

### Surveillance Expansion

- Deployment of new surveillance technologies in urban centers
- Mandatory registration requirements for mobile devices and SIM cards
- Increased monitoring of social media platforms

### Legal Restrictions

- New cybersecurity laws that criminalize legitimate online expression
- Vague provisions on "fake news" used to target government critics
- Harsh penalties for online dissent, including lengthy prison sentences

## Impact on Society

The deterioration of internet freedom has had profound effects:

- Chilling effect on free expression
- Barriers to accessing critical information
- Obstacles for civil society organizations
- Limitations on political participation

## Recommendations

Based on our findings, we recommend:

1. **For Government**: Repeal restrictive laws and respect international standards on freedom of expression
2. **For Tech Companies**: Resist censorship demands and improve transparency
3. **For Civil Society**: Strengthen digital security training and advocacy
4. **For International Community**: Support internet freedom initiatives and apply diplomatic pressure

## Methodology

This report is based on:
- Technical testing of 500 websites
- Interviews with 120 internet users
- Legal analysis of relevant legislation
- Monitoring of 50 cases of internet-related prosecutions

We will continue to monitor these trends and advocate for policies that protect internet freedom as a fundamental right for all people in Burma.
